      One of the guest speakers I found particularily inspiring was Lucas David from Kettering University. Although he did not speak directly about jobs in the computer science field, I thought his perspective on college was something I'd never heard before. It allowed me to open my options. I really like the way he described Kettering as a working college. The idea that your course is based on getting experience in your field is really cool. Another speaker I enjoyed was Shawn Mehaffey from Chevron. His talk was entertaining and it was really interesting to see how he grew and reached the opportunities he had today.

      For the past two years, I have been volunteering at a non profit event called Night To Shine. It's to hold a prom night for people with special needs. The first year I volunteered, in 2019, I was a date for a person with special needs. The next year, in 2020, I was working the red carpet and also helped with cleanup. These volunteer opportunities were really valuable. I learned a lot about working with people with special needs. Being able to work with people with different limitations and different ways of living is a really good skill to have for any job. I also learned a lot about communication. I had to work with a lot of different people for both nights and it helped me with my collaboration and communication skills.
